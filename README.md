# Assignment 1

This project is a TypeScript-based application that includes various algorithms and utilities. The main entry point for the application is `index.js` located in the `dist` directory.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)
-   npm (Node Package Manager)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gorban40/assignment-1.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Before building the project, ensure all dependencies are installed. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Build

To compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the compiled JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.

## Run
